            {`Modern slavery is a heinous crime and a morally reprehensible act
            that deprives a person's liberty and dignity for another person's
            gain. It is a real problem for millions of people around the world,
            including many in developed countries, who are being kept and
            exploited in various forms of slavery. Every company is at risk of
            being involved in this crime through its own operations and its
            supply chain. At PamperTree, we have a zero-tolerance approach to
            modern slavery and are fully committed to preventing slavery and
            human trafficking in our operation and supply chain. We have taken
            concrete steps to tackle modern slavery, as outlined in our
            statement. This statement sets out the actions that we have taken to
            understand all potential modern slavery risks related to our
            business and to implement steps to prevent slavery and human
            trafficking during the financial year 2019.`}

            part of our supply chain. We establish a relationship of trust and
            integrity with all our suppliers, which is built upon mutually
            beneficial factors. Our supplier selection and on-boarding procedure
